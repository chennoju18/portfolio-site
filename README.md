## 💼 About Me

I’m a results-driven Business Analyst with 5+ years of experience translating business needs into actionable technical solutions. My expertise lies in:

- Requirements elicitation (JAD, interviews)
- Process mapping (UML, BPMN)
- Agile (Scrum, SAFe), Jira, Confluence
- Data validation using SQL
- Report building (Power BI, Tableau)
- Bridging the gap between business & development

My work often involves collaborating with developers, testers, and data teams — a strength I’ve applied while building automation tools, dashboards, and full-stack PoCs.
